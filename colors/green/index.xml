It was then privatized during 2002-3 by Murtaza Rakhimov, the president of Bashkortostan, an ally of Yeltsin&amp;rsquo;s, with a controlling interest in Bashkir Capital, a holding company controlled by Rakhimov&amp;rsquo;s son, Ural Rakhimov. In 2009 a controlling interest in Bashneft was acquired for $2 billion by Vladimir Yevtushenkov and placed in his holding company, Sistema, but in July 2014 he was jailed and 72% of Sistema&amp;rsquo;s interest in Bashneft seized by the Russian government.</description></item><item turbo="true"><turbo:content>

Users are able to generate LCC through the process of mining: both SHA256 and Hive Mining, an agent-based mining system, which requires no specialized hardware: anything from a Raspberry Pi to your normal desktop PC is fine. Existing SHA256 miners and pools are not affected. Proof-of-work blocks are accepted by the network at any time, so SHA256 mining hardware never needs to stand idle.<p>You can download theLitecoin Cashlogo on full-version of the page.</p>
