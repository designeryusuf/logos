      <description>Adobe Lightroom is a family of image organization and image manipulation software developed by Adobe Systems for Windows, macOS, iOS, Android, and tvOS (Apple TV). It allows importing/saving, viewing, organizing, tagging, editing, and sharing large numbers of digital images. Unlike Photoshop, Lightroom&amp;rsquo;s edits are always non-destructive by keeping the original image and the edits applied to it saved separately. Despite sharing its name with Adobe Photoshop, it cannot perform many Photoshop functions such as doctoring (adding, removing or altering the appearance of individual image items), rendering text or 3D objects on images, or modifying individual video frames.</description>

      <description>Adobe Photoshop is a raster graphics editor developed and published by Adobe Inc. for Windows and macOS. It was originally created in 1988 by Thomas and John Knoll. Since then, this software has become the industry standard not only in raster graphics editing, but in digital art as a whole. The software&amp;rsquo;s name has thus become a generic trademark, leading to its usage as a verb (e.g. &amp;ldquo;to photoshop an image&amp;rdquo;, &amp;ldquo;photoshopping&amp;rdquo;, and &amp;ldquo;photoshop contest&amp;rdquo;) although Adobe discourages such use.</description>

      <description> Docker is a set of platform-as-a-service (PaaS) products that use OS-level virtualization to deliver software in packages called containers. Containers are isolated from one another and bundle their own software, libraries and configuration files; they can communicate with each other through well-defined channels. All containers are run by a single operating-system kernel and are thus more lightweight than virtual machines.

      <description>New Facebook Logo  The company unveiled its new logo Tuesday, April 30, 2019. The new logo retains the distinctive “f” letter, but replaces the rounded square container with a circle. In addition, the new look moves the “f” to the center of the icon, rather than the right side like in the old version. The “Facebook” logotype that has the full name of the company is now relegated to use only for the company — but not its services.</description>
