1inch is a decentralized exchange (DEX) aggregator, connecting several DEXes into one platform to allow its users to find the most efficient swapping routes across all platforms. In order for a user to find the best price for a swap, they need to look at every exchange — DEX aggregators eliminate the need for manually checking, bringing efficiency to swapping on DEXs.
DEX aggregators work by sourcing liquidity from different DExs, meaning that they are able to offer users better token swap rates than they could find on any single DEX, in the shortest time possible.<p>You can download the1inchlogo on full-version of the page.</p>

Cobham was originally founded by Sir Alan Cobham as Flight Refuelling Limited in 1934. During 1939, British airline Imperial Airways performed several non-stop crossings of the Atlantic using equipment provided by FRL. During the late 1940s, the company&amp;rsquo;s aerial refuelling equipment broke new ground, including a round-the-world flight by specially-equipped Boeing B-50 Superfortresses in 1948 and the demonstration of the now-widely used &amp;lsquo;probe and drogue&amp;rsquo; method of air-to-air refuelling for the first time in 1949.</description></item><item turbo="true"><turbo:content>
