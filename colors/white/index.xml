Swift works with Apple&amp;rsquo;s Cocoa and Cocoa Touch frameworks, and a key aspect of Swift&amp;rsquo;s design was the ability to interoperate with the huge body of existing Objective-C code developed for Apple products over the previous decades.<p>You can download theSwiftlogo on full-version of the page.</p>
