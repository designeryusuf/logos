Aeron’s solution relies on blockchain technology to track aircraft maintenance and pilot logs. Aeron is constructing a database and an online system that is decentralized, hosting global data on aircraft, flight schools, and pilots.

Litecoin Cash (LCC) is a cryptocurrency forked from Litecoin Coin. Users are able to generate LCC through the process of mining: both SHA256 and Hive Mining, an agent-based mining system, which requires no specialized hardware: anything from a Raspberry Pi to your normal desktop PC is fine. Existing SHA256 miners and pools are not affected. Proof-of-work blocks are accepted by the network at any time, so SHA256 mining hardware never needs to stand idle.<p>You can download theLitecoin Cashlogo on full-version of the page.</p>
