AppCoins is an open and distributed protocol for app stores based on the Ethereum blockchain and smart contracts. It redesigns app advertising, in-app purchases (IAP), and app approval flows through a circular model. As a higher share of the advertising and IAP revenue is kept within the app ecosystem, more value is retained in the app economy. Being an open protocol, it would theoretically provide more transparency and trust. Multiple app stores can implement and benefit from this and stakeholders will have to contribute to its development and adoption.<p>You can download theAppCoinslogo on full-version of the page.</p>

It redesigns app advertising, in-app purchases (IAP), and app approval flows through a circular model. As a higher share of the advertising and IAP revenue is kept within the app ecosystem, more value is retained in the app economy. Being an open protocol, it would theoretically provide more transparency and trust. Multiple app stores can implement and benefit from this and stakeholders will have to contribute to its development and adoption.</description></item><item turbo="true"><turbo:content>
