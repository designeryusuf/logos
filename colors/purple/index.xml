BEAM is a confidential decentralized finance (DeFi) platform that runs on a combination of two blockchain protocols (LelantusMW and Mimblewimble).
In the early years of the industry, transactions with public-blockchain cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin (BTC) were thought to be untraceable. With developments in blockchain analysis, it became clear that transactions can actually be traced back to the senders, posing a great threat to users' privacy.
To solve this issue, BEAM came up with innovative ways of increasing the anonymity of transactions, address balances and user identities.<p>You can download theBeamlogo on full-version of the page.</p>

SushiSwap aims to diversify the AMM market and also add additional features not previously present on Uniswap, such as increased rewards for network participants via its in-house token, SUSHI.</description></item><item turbo="true"><turbo:content>
