The Oceano Azul Foundation is an international organization founded by the Sociedade Francisco Manuel dos Santos and based in Portugal with the mission of contributing to the sustainability of a healthy and productive ocean. Combining scientific study, political and economic activism, together with a deep ethical commitment, the Foundation integrates many human perspectives to “look at the planet’s sustainability from the ocean’s point of view.” The Oceano Azul Foundation manages the Oceanário de Lisboa, for which Chermayeff &amp;amp; Geismar &amp;amp; Haviv designed the visual identity, as well as major tile murals.
