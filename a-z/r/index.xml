Rust is an iron oxide, a usually reddish-brown oxide formed by the reaction of iron and oxygen in the catalytic presence of water or air moisture. Rust consists of hydrous iron oxides and iron oxide-hydroxide, and is typically associated with the corrosion of refined iron. Given sufficient time, any iron mass, in the presence of water and oxygen, could eventually convert entirely to rust. Surface rust is commonly flaky and friable, and provides no passivational protection to the underlying iron, unlike the formation of patina on copper surfaces.<p>You can download theRust languagelogo on full-version of the page.</p>

It operates primarily in the fields of wireless communications, cable television, telephony and Internet connectivity, with significant additional telecommunications and mass media assets. Rogers has its headquarters in Toronto, Ontario. The company traces its origins to 1925 when Edward S. Rogers Sr. founded Rogers Vacuum Tube Company to sell batteryless radios, although this present enterprise dates to 1960, when Ted Rogers and a partner acquired the CHFI-FM radio station; they then became part-owners of a group that established the CFTO television station.</description></item><item turbo="true"><turbo:content>
