      <description>Budweiser is an American-style pale lager produced by Anheuser-Busch, currently part of the transnational corporation Anheuser-Busch InBev and produced in various breweries around the world. There is an unrelated lager also called Budweiser, originating centuries ago in Budweis, Bohemia and made by Budweiser Budvar Brewery of České Budějovice, Czech Republic; this has given rise to a trademark dispute preventing Anheuser-Busch from using the &amp;ldquo;Budweiser&amp;rdquo; name in some regions, leading to the exclusive use of &amp;ldquo;Bud&amp;rdquo; in those markets.</description>
