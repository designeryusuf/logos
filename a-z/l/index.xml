The LibreOffice suite consists of programs for word processing, creating and editing of spreadsheets, slideshows, diagrams and drawings, working with databases, and composing mathematical formulae. It is available in 115 languages. As its native file format to save documents for all of its applications, LibreOffice uses the Open Document Format for Office Applications, or OpenDocument, an international standard developed jointly by the International Organization for Standardization and the International Electrotechnical Commission.</description></item><item turbo="true"><turbo:content>
