Obyte claims to be the first DAG-based cryptocurrency platform to support dApps. Due to the absence of miners and blocks, the team claims that there is no risk of front-running and other miner manipulation, and dApps are safer and easier to develop than blockchain-based dApps. DApps are developed in Oscript - a new language that avoids many unsafe programming patterns common in earlier dApp platforms.
