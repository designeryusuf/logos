      <description>History of the Citi Group logo (from pentagram.com and medium.com)

After a brief negotiation the budget for the brand overhaul was pegged at almost $10m, with the design of the logo itself making up $1.5m of that. Now $1.</description>

      <description>History of the Citi Bank logo (from pentagram.com)
In 1998 financial giants Citicorp and Travelers Group merged to create Citigroup, the largest financial company in the world.

A visual language and colors and materials palette were developed to represent the new brand.</description>
