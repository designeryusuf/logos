&lt;! [CDATA[<header><h1> Bluzelle (BLZ) Logo</h1><figure><img src="https://logotyp.us/files525/bluzelle.svg"/></figure></header>
Bluzelle is a decentralized data layer for dapps to manage data in a secure, censorship-resistant and highly scalable manner. Bluzelle is powered by Cosmos and its BFT technology Tendermint, making it compatible with various blockchains. As developers continue to build Dapps, relying on centralized databases by AWS, Microsoft and others is a centralized point of failure. True freedom requires the full stack to be decentralized, not just one part. That’s where Bluzelle aims to provide a critical piece in the advancement of Defi, supply chains, gaming, and other Web 3.<p>You can download theBluzellelogo on full-version of the page.</p>

&lt;! [CDATA[<header><h1> Elastos (ELA) Logo</h1><figure><img src="https://logotyp.us/files525/elastos.svg"/></figure></header>
Elastos aims to be a blockchain-powered version of the internet. The project originates all the way back to the year 2000; however, the current version that is based on blockchain technology and has been in active development by Elastos was founded in June of 2017.
The team behind the project genuinely believe that Ethereum, as well as DApp platforms, face limitations in scaling. While they are great for smart contracts, they are slow, not flexible at all, and inconvenient for full applications, according to Elastos.<p>You can download theElastoslogo on full-version of the page.</p>

&lt;! [CDATA[<header><h1> BitTorrent (BTT) Logo</h1><figure><img src="https://logotyp.us/files525/bittorrent.svg"/></figure></header>
BitTorrent is a popular peer-to-peer (P2P) file sharing and torrent platform which has become increasingly decentralized in recent years.
Originally released in July 2001, BitTorrent was purchased by blockchain platform TRON in July 2018.
Since its acquisition, BitTorrent has added various new tools, with a dedicated native cryptocurrency token, BTT, released in February 2019. BTT was launched on TRON’s own blockchain, using its TRC-10 standard.
According to its official literature, BitTorrent is currently the “largest decentralized P2P communications protocol” in the world.<p>You can download theBitTorrentlogo on full-version of the page.</p>

Holo is a peer-to-peer distributed platform for hosting decentralized applications built using Holochain, a framework for developing DApps that does not require the use of blockchain technology. The goal of Holo is to serve as a bridge between the broader internet and apps built using Holochain, offering an ecosystem and marketplace in which DApps are easily accessible, as they are hosted on the internet by Holo network participants.
The Holo network will be facilitated using a token called HoloFuel, which is actively being tested and will act as an accounting system to pay hosts for their services.<p>You can download theHolologo on full-version of the page.</p>

MaidSafeCoin (MAID) was launched in February 2006. It is a project that aims to decentralize the Internet. According to the developers, its concept predates Bitcoin (BTC) by several years.
The SAFE network works similarly to the TOR network, meaning that all online content is distributed and accessed through a peer-to-peer (P2P) mesh network.
MaidSafeCoin is a token for SafeCoin, a decentralized currency for the decentralized SAFE network, which is maintained by the users’ extra hard disk space, processing power and data connectivity level.<p>You can download theMaidSafeCoinlogo on full-version of the page.</p>

RIF (Rootstock Infrastructure Framework) is a third layer on top of Bitcoin that provides a wide range of solutions based on blockchain technology such as payments, storage, and domaining (RNS). It is a tech-stack where the $RIF token is required to use these services. RIF aims to create collaborative marketplaces where individuals interact on a peer-to-peer basis coordinated by immutable smart contracts in order to exchange information, value, and services with full control and transparency.<p>You can download theRSKlogo on full-version of the page.</p>
