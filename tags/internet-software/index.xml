Napster is a set of three music-focused online services. It was founded in 1999 as a pioneering peer-to-peer file sharing Internet software that emphasized sharing digital audio files, typically audio songs, encoded in MP3 format. As the software became popular, the company ran into legal difficulties over copyright infringement. It ceased operations and was eventually acquired by Roxio. In its second incarnation, Napster became an online music store until it was acquired by Rhapsody from Best Buy on December 1, 2011.<p>You can download theNapsterlogo on full-version of the page.</p>
