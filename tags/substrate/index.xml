ChainX aims to facilitate asset interoperability with other blockchains It measures users' mining power based on the market value of BTC, DOT, ETH, ERC20, EOS, and other assets that are deposited in an inter-chain bridge. ChainX is an inter-chain crypto-asset financial blockchain that will become a Polkadot parachain when the platform launches. ChainX is one of the first blockchains built on Substrate, a framework that makes it easy to build upgradable and efficient blockchains.<p>You can download theChainXlogo on full-version of the page.</p>

SORA is a new economic system that decentralizes the concept of a central bank as well as a network that implements a new way to architect a parachain blockchain that connects to the Polkadot relay chain and ecosystem with in-built tools focused on DeFi.
The SORA Network excels at providing tools for decentralized applications that use digital assets, such as atomic token swaps, bridging tokens to other blockchains, and creating programmatic rules involving digital assets.<p>You can download theSoralogo on full-version of the page.</p>
