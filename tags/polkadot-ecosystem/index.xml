ChainX aims to facilitate asset interoperability with other blockchains It measures users' mining power based on the market value of BTC, DOT, ETH, ERC20, EOS, and other assets that are deposited in an inter-chain bridge. ChainX is an inter-chain crypto-asset financial blockchain that will become a Polkadot parachain when the platform launches. ChainX is one of the first blockchains built on Substrate, a framework that makes it easy to build upgradable and efficient blockchains.<p>You can download theChainXlogo on full-version of the page.</p>
