Arweave is a decentralized storage network that seeks to offer a platform for the indefinite storage of data. Describing itself as &amp;ldquo;a collectively owned hard drive that never forgets,&amp;rdquo; the network primarily hosts &amp;ldquo;the permaweb&amp;rdquo; — a permanent, decentralized web with a number of community-driven applications and platforms.
The Arweave network uses a native cryptocurrency, AR, to pay &amp;ldquo;miners&amp;rdquo; to indefinitely store the network&amp;rsquo;s information.
The project was first announced as Archain in August 2017, later rebranding to Arweave in February 2018 and officially launching in June 2018.<p>You can download theArweavelogo on full-version of the page.</p>

Holo is a peer-to-peer distributed platform for hosting decentralized applications built using Holochain, a framework for developing DApps that does not require the use of blockchain technology. The goal of Holo is to serve as a bridge between the broader internet and apps built using Holochain, offering an ecosystem and marketplace in which DApps are easily accessible, as they are hosted on the internet by Holo network participants.
The Holo network will be facilitated using a token called HoloFuel, which is actively being tested and will act as an accounting system to pay hosts for their services.<p>You can download theHolologo on full-version of the page.</p>
