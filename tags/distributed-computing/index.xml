Mysterium Network is building the world’s largest P2P network to power Web 3 privacy applications. An open source, Swiss-based company founded in 2017, Mysterium is rewiring the internet so it’s secure, free and accessible for all. Mysterium held a token sale through which it raised $18 million USD.The network is transparent and permission-less by default, made up of layered VPN protocols, blockchain and smart contracts. It lays the groundwork for all kinds of next-gen services to be built on top of it, including Mysterium’s flagship product, the decentralized VPN app.<p>You can download theMysteriumlogo on full-version of the page.</p>

&lt;! [CDATA[<header><h1> Skycoin (SKY) Logo</h1><figure><img src="https://logotyp.us/files525/skycoin.svg"/></figure></header>
Skycoin (SKY) is an open-source, community-owned, hardware-based peer-to-peer internet that leverages the incentive structure of the blockchain.
Skycoin’s platform has been billed as &amp;lsquo;completely secure, infinitely scalable, and ISP independent&amp;rsquo; by the project team. Written in Golang and running on the Obelisk consensus algorithm, Skycoin is focused on security, usability, and ease of use. Obelisk is predicated on the notion of ‘web of trust dynamics’, which makes consensus decisions depending upon the influence score of each node.<p>You can download theSkycoinlogo on full-version of the page.</p>

Handshake is a decentralized permissionless system that is intended to incentivize a distributed network of computers to operate a system for domain name ownership.
Under Handshake, every peer is tasked with validating and managing the root DNS naming zone, with the objective of providing an alternative to current certificate authorities and naming systems.
Different participants across the internet such as social networking handles and domains rely on a centralized approach.<p>You can download theHandshakelogo on full-version of the page.</p>

&lt;! [CDATA[<header><h1> Streamr (DATA) Logo</h1><figure><img src="https://logotyp.us/files525/streamr.svg"/></figure></header>
Streamr is a distributed open-source project, crowdfunded in 2017. The project&amp;rsquo;s goal is to build the decentralized infrastructure for real-time data, replacing centralized message brokers with a global peer-to-peer network. By relying on cryptography instead of trust, the open-source network aims to enable data sharing and monetization in IoT and smart cities, business consortia, individual crowd selling through Data Unions and the decentralized web (Web 3.0).

&lt;! [CDATA[<header><h1> Arweave (AR) Logo</h1><figure><img src="https://logotyp.us/files525/arweave.svg"/></figure></header>
Arweave is a decentralized storage network that seeks to offer a platform for the indefinite storage of data. Describing itself as &amp;ldquo;a collectively owned hard drive that never forgets,&amp;rdquo; the network primarily hosts &amp;ldquo;the permaweb&amp;rdquo; — a permanent, decentralized web with a number of community-driven applications and platforms.
The Arweave network uses a native cryptocurrency, AR, to pay &amp;ldquo;miners&amp;rdquo; to indefinitely store the network&amp;rsquo;s information.
The project was first announced as Archain in August 2017, later rebranding to Arweave in February 2018 and officially launching in June 2018.<p>You can download theArweavelogo on full-version of the page.</p>

Holo is a peer-to-peer distributed platform for hosting decentralized applications built using Holochain, a framework for developing DApps that does not require the use of blockchain technology. The goal of Holo is to serve as a bridge between the broader internet and apps built using Holochain, offering an ecosystem and marketplace in which DApps are easily accessible, as they are hosted on the internet by Holo network participants.
The Holo network will be facilitated using a token called HoloFuel, which is actively being tested and will act as an accounting system to pay hosts for their services.<p>You can download theHolologo on full-version of the page.</p>
