Google Glass, or simply Glass, is a brand of smart glasses—an optical head-mounted display designed in the shape of a pair of glasses. It was developed by X with the mission of producing a ubiquitous computer. Google Glass displays information in a smartphone-like, hands-free format. Wearers communicate with the Internet via natural language voice commands. Google started selling a prototype of Google Glass to qualified &amp;ldquo;Glass Explorers&amp;rdquo; in the US on April 15, 2013, for a limited period for $1,500, before it became available to the public on May 15, 2014.<p>You can download theGoogle Glasslogo on full-version of the page.</p>
