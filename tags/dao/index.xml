pNetwork is a solution enabling cross-chain interactions between dApps on multiple networks.
It provides a way for moving assets from one blockchain to another, for example, Bitcoin on Ethereum, but also many others. This is done via pTokens - 1:1 pegged representations of underlying assets on another blockchain.
Moreover, not only assets can be moved cross-chain, but also NFTs and cross-chain transfers and smart contract interactions.
pNetwork is a progressively decentralized platform and managed via a DAO where users can stake PNT and get proportional voting rights.<p>You can download thepNetworklogo on full-version of the page.</p>

SushiSwap (SUSHI) is an example of an automated market maker (AMM). An increasingly popular tool among cryptocurrency users, AMMs are decentralized exchanges which use smart contracts to create markets for any given pair of tokens.
SushiSwap launched in September 2020 as a fork of Uniswap, the AMM which has become synonymous with the decentralized finance (DeFi) movement and associated trading boom in DeFi tokens.
SushiSwap aims to diversify the AMM market and also add additional features not previously present on Uniswap, such as increased rewards for network participants via its in-house token, SUSHI.<p>You can download theSushiSwaplogo on full-version of the page.</p>

UMA, or Universal Market Access, is a protocol for the creation of synthetic assets based on the Ethereum (ETH) blockchain. UMA was launched in December 2018.
Synthetic assets are a class of assets that represent different, underlying assets and have the same value. UMA specifically enables its users to design and create self-executing, self-enforcing financial contracts secured by economic incentives and run them on Ethereum’s blockchain.
In essence, UMA allows counterparties to digitize and automate any real-world financial derivatives, such as futures, contracts for differences (CFDs) or total return swaps.<p>You can download theUMAlogo on full-version of the page.</p>
