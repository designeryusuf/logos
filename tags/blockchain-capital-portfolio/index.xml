The Nervos Network describes itself as an open-source public blockchain ecosystem and collection of protocols. The Nervos CKB (Common Knowledge Base) is the layer 1, proof of work public blockchain protocol of the Nervos Network. It reportedly allows any crypto-asset to be stored with the security, immutability and permissionless nature of Bitcoin while enabling smart contracts and layer 2 scaling. It aims to capture the total network value through its &amp;ldquo;store of value&amp;rdquo; crypto-economic design and native token, the CKByte.<p>You can download theNervos Networklogo on full-version of the page.</p>

Stacks is a layer-1 blockchain solution that is designed to bring smart contracts and decentralized applications (DApps) to Bitcoin (BTC). These smart contracts are brought to Bitcoin without changing any of the features that make it so powerful — including its security and stability.
These DApps are open and modular, meaning developers can build on top of each other&amp;rsquo;s apps to produce features that are simply not possible in a regular app.<p>You can download theStackslogo on full-version of the page.</p>
