AppCoins is an open and distributed protocol for app stores based on the Ethereum blockchain and smart contracts. It redesigns app advertising, in-app purchases (IAP), and app approval flows through a circular model. As a higher share of the advertising and IAP revenue is kept within the app ecosystem, more value is retained in the app economy. Being an open protocol, it would theoretically provide more transparency and trust. Multiple app stores can implement and benefit from this and stakeholders will have to contribute to its development and adoption.<p>You can download theAppCoinslogo on full-version of the page.</p>

It redesigns app advertising, in-app purchases (IAP), and app approval flows through a circular model. As a higher share of the advertising and IAP revenue is kept within the app ecosystem, more value is retained in the app economy. Being an open protocol, it would theoretically provide more transparency and trust. Multiple app stores can implement and benefit from this and stakeholders will have to contribute to its development and adoption.</description></item><item turbo="true"><turbo:content>

Vite has built a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) based smart-contract platform, with a Snapshot Chain structure to facilitate zero-fee transactions and optimize transaction speed, reliability, and security. The Snapshot Chain of Vite utilizes Hierarchical Delegated Proof of Stake (“HDPoS”) to achieve network consensus, while supernodes take only staking rewards and no transaction fees. Vite virtual machine maintains compatibility with EVM, and utilizes asynchronous smart contract language, Solidity++.
The VITE token is the currency for simple token transactions and smart-contract executions on the Vite network, with users staking VITE for transaction quota instead of consuming gas.<p>You can download theVITElogo on full-version of the page.</p>

Released in December 2018, TomoChain (TOMO) is a project that attempts to improve the scalability of the Ethereum (ETH) blockchain. This is primarily done via increasing its transactions per second (TPS) capacity.
The eventual goal of the project is to build a blockchain infrastructure for decentralized apps (DApps) and improve integration and security. TomoChain’s solution is to offer smart contract scalability, a task that requires solving how the blockchain can handle a higher number of transactions per second, exponentially increasing the utility of the smart contracts for real-world use cases and applications.<p>You can download theTomoChainlogo on full-version of the page.</p>

Revain’s ultimate goal is to create a legitimate and genuine feedback structure for all global products and services that utilize emerging technologies, such as machine learning and blockchain.<p>You can download theRevainlogo on full-version of the page.</p>

Storj, pronounced as “storage,” is an open-source cloud storage platform. Basically, it uses a decentralized network of nodes to host user data. The platform also secures hosted data using advanced encryption.
In a white paper published in December,2014, Storj was first introduced to the world as a concept. It was to be a decentralized peer-to-peer encrypted cloud storage platform.
Two years later, an updated white paper was published. Here, a decentralized network — connecting users who need cloud storage space with those who have hard drive space to sell — was described.<p>You can download theStorjlogo on full-version of the page.</p>

Zilliqa is a public, permissionless blockchain that is designed to offer high throughput with the ability to complete thousands of transactions per second. It seeks to solve the issue of blockchain scalability and speed by employing sharding as a second-layer scaling solution. The platform is home to many decentralized applications, and as of October 2020, it also allows for staking and yield farming.
Development work officially started on Zilliqa in June 2017, and its testnet went live in March 2018.<p>You can download theZilliqalogo on full-version of the page.</p>
