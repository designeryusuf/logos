Arweave is a decentralized storage network that seeks to offer a platform for the indefinite storage of data. Describing itself as &amp;ldquo;a collectively owned hard drive that never forgets,&amp;rdquo; the network primarily hosts &amp;ldquo;the permaweb&amp;rdquo; — a permanent, decentralized web with a number of community-driven applications and platforms.
The Arweave network uses a native cryptocurrency, AR, to pay &amp;ldquo;miners&amp;rdquo; to indefinitely store the network&amp;rsquo;s information.
The project was first announced as Archain in August 2017, later rebranding to Arweave in February 2018 and officially launching in June 2018.<p>You can download theArweavelogo on full-version of the page.</p>

BitTorrent is a popular peer-to-peer (P2P) file sharing and torrent platform which has become increasingly decentralized in recent years.
Originally released in July 2001, BitTorrent was purchased by blockchain platform TRON in July 2018.
Since its acquisition, BitTorrent has added various new tools, with a dedicated native cryptocurrency token, BTT, released in February 2019. BTT was launched on TRON’s own blockchain, using its TRC-10 standard.
According to its official literature, BitTorrent is currently the “largest decentralized P2P communications protocol” in the world.<p>You can download theBitTorrentlogo on full-version of the page.</p>

Storj, pronounced as “storage,” is an open-source cloud storage platform. Basically, it uses a decentralized network of nodes to host user data. The platform also secures hosted data using advanced encryption.
In a white paper published in December,2014, Storj was first introduced to the world as a concept. It was to be a decentralized peer-to-peer encrypted cloud storage platform.
Two years later, an updated white paper was published. Here, a decentralized network — connecting users who need cloud storage space with those who have hard drive space to sell — was described.<p>You can download theStorjlogo on full-version of the page.</p>
