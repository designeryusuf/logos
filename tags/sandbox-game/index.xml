Garry&amp;rsquo;s Mod is a 2006 sandbox game developed by Facepunch Studios and published by Valve. The base game mode of Garry&amp;rsquo;s Mod has no set objectives and provides the player with a world to freely manipulate objects in. Other game modes, notably Trouble in Terrorist Town, are created by other developers as mods and are installed separately, by means such as the Steam Workshop. Garry&amp;rsquo;s Mod was created by Garry Newman as a mod for Valve&amp;rsquo;s Source game engine and released in December 2004, before being expanded into a standalone release that was published by Valve in November 2006.<p>You can download theGarrys Modlogo on full-version of the page.</p>
