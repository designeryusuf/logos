Bitcoin SV is the result of a lot of drama on the BTC blockchain.
It all began when Bitcoin suffered a hard fork in 2017 — splitting the network and resulting in the creation of a new altcoin called Bitcoin Cash.
A year later, in 2018, Bitcoin Cash suffered a hard fork of its own, and Bitcoin SV was born.
Bitcoin SV (SV stands for Satoshi Vision) bills itself as the original Bitcoin — a cryptocurrency that stays true to the goals of pseudonymous founder Satoshi Nakamoto.<p>You can download theBitcoin SVlogo on full-version of the page.</p>
