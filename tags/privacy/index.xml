Apollo views itself as unique in that its transaction speed is 1-2 seconds. Apollo claims to not suffer from blockchain sustainability issues, such as blockchain bloat. Nearly every blockchain on the market grows in size as its transaction speeds get slower. Apollo reportedly gets faster the more users that are on the system and its database can reportedly grow to unlimited sizes due to technologies incorporated into it, such as sharding, adaptive forging, and node time synchronization.<p>You can download theApollo Currencylogo on full-version of the page.</p>

Haven Protocol is similar to an offshore bank where users can create private tokens that represent stable and volatile assets, including commodities and fiat currencies (such as USD). The protocol is based on Monero, which focuses on secure, private and untraceable transactions.
As a result, most of the features of Monero extend to the Haven protocol, including the bulletproofs and other privacy tech. The base currency of Haven is the XHV, which is burnt to provide users with private, untraceable, synthetic assets and commodities called xAssets.<p>You can download theHaven Protocollogo on full-version of the page.</p>

Keep is an incentivized network for storing and encrypting private data on the public blockchain. The network is made of off-chain containers for private data known as keeps, while the KEEP work token enables it to be completely permissionless. Keep solves the main problem holding back blockchain adoption: that data on public blockchains are public. With Keep, developers can finally build fully decentralized apps.

Secret is the native coin of the Secret Network, a decentralized network for private / secure computation. Nodes on the network (known as secret nodes) can perform generalizable computations over encrypted data, which allows smart contracts (known as secret contracts) to use private and sensitive data as inputs. Our focus is on computational privacy, not just transactional privacy. Developers can build decentralized, privacy-preserving &amp;ldquo;Secret Apps&amp;rdquo; on the network. The privacy functionality of the Secret Network is critical for many fields, including decentralized finance, Web3, machine learning, access control, and many more.<p>You can download theSecretlogo on full-version of the page.</p>
