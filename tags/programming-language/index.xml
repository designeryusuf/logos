Dart is a programming language designed for client development, such as for the web and mobile apps. It is developed by Google and can also be used to build server and desktop applications. Dart is an object-oriented, class-based, garbage-collected language with C-style syntax. Dart can compile to either native code or JavaScript. It supports interfaces, mixins, abstract classes, reified generics, and type inference.

Erlang is a general-purpose, concurrent, functional programming language, and a garbage-collected runtime system. The term Erlang is used interchangeably with Erlang/OTP, or Open Telecom Platform, which consists of the Erlang runtime system, several ready-to-use components mainly written in Erlang, and a set of design principles for Erlang programs. The Erlang runtime system is designed for systems with these traits: • Distributed • Fault-tolerant • Soft real-time • Highly available, non-stop applications • Hot swapping, where code can be changed without stopping a system.<p>You can download theErlanglogo on full-version of the page.</p>

&lt;! [CDATA[<header><h1>Kotlin Logo</h1><figure><img src="https://logotyp.us/files/kotlin.svg"/></figure></header>
Kotlin is a cross-platform, statically typed, general-purpose programming language with type inference. Kotlin is designed to interoperate fully with Java, and the JVM version of Kotlin&amp;rsquo;s standard library depends on the Java Class Library, but type inference allows its syntax to be more concise. Kotlin mainly targets the JVM, but also compiles to JavaScript or native code; e.g., for native iOS apps sharing business logic with Android apps. Language development costs are borne by JetBrains, while the Kotlin Foundation protects the Kotlin trademark.<p>You can download theKotlinlogo on full-version of the page.</p>

&lt;! [CDATA[<header><h1>Lua Logo</h1><figure><img src="https://logotyp.us/files/lua.svg"/></figure></header>
Lua is a lightweight, high-level, multi-paradigm programming language designed primarily for embedded use in applications. Lua is cross-platform, since the interpreter of compiled bytecode is written in ANSI C, and Lua has a relatively simple C API to embed it into applications. Lua was originally designed in 1993 as a language for extending software applications to meet the increasing demand for customization at the time. It provided the basic facilities of most procedural programming languages, but more complicated or domain-specific features were not included; rather, it included mechanisms for extending the language, allowing programmers to implement such features.<p>You can download theLualogo on full-version of the page.</p>

C++ is a general-purpose programming language created by Bjarne Stroustrup as an extension of the C programming language, or &amp;ldquo;C with Classes&amp;rdquo;. The language has expanded significantly over time, and modern C++ now has object-oriented, generic, and functional features in addition to facilities for low-level memory manipulation. It is almost always implemented as a compiled language, and many vendors provide C++ compilers, including the Free Software Foundation, LLVM, Microsoft, Intel, Oracle, and IBM, so it is available on many platforms.<p>You can download theC plus pluslogo on full-version of the page.</p>

Python is an interpreted high-level general-purpose programming language. Python&amp;rsquo;s design philosophy emphasizes code readability with its notable use of significant indentation. Its language constructs as well as its object-oriented approach aim to help programmers write clear, logical code for small and large-scale projects. Python is dynamically-typed and garbage-collected. It supports multiple programming paradigms, including structured, object-oriented and functional programming. Python is often described as a &amp;ldquo;batteries included&amp;rdquo; language due to its comprehensive standard library.<p>You can download thePythonlogo on full-version of the page.</p>

R is a programming language and free software environment for statistical computing and graphics supported by the R Core Team and the R Foundation for Statistical Computing. The R language is widely used among statisticians and data miners for developing statistical software and data analysis. Polls, data mining surveys, and studies of scholarly literature databases show substantial increases in R&amp;rsquo;s popularity; as of July 2021, R ranks 12th in the TIOBE index, a measure of popularity of programming languages.<p>You can download theRlogo on full-version of the page.</p>

&lt;! [CDATA[<header><h1>Rust language Logo</h1><figure><img src="https://logotyp.us/files/rust-language.svg"/></figure></header>
Rust is an iron oxide, a usually reddish-brown oxide formed by the reaction of iron and oxygen in the catalytic presence of water or air moisture. Rust consists of hydrous iron oxides and iron oxide-hydroxide, and is typically associated with the corrosion of refined iron. Given sufficient time, any iron mass, in the presence of water and oxygen, could eventually convert entirely to rust. Surface rust is commonly flaky and friable, and provides no passivational protection to the underlying iron, unlike the formation of patina on copper surfaces.<p>You can download theRust languagelogo on full-version of the page.</p>

Swift is a general-purpose, multi-paradigm, compiled programming language developed by Apple Inc. and the open-source community. First released in 2014, Swift was developed as a replacement for Apple&amp;rsquo;s earlier programming language Objective-C, as Objective-C had been largely unchanged since the early 1980s and lacked modern language features. Swift works with Apple&amp;rsquo;s Cocoa and Cocoa Touch frameworks, and a key aspect of Swift&amp;rsquo;s design was the ability to interoperate with the huge body of existing Objective-C code developed for Apple products over the previous decades.<p>You can download theSwiftlogo on full-version of the page.</p>

TypeScript is a programming language developed and maintained by Microsoft. It is a strict syntactical superset of JavaScript and adds optional static typing to the language. TypeScript is designed for the development of large applications and transcompiles to JavaScript. As TypeScript is a superset of JavaScript, existing JavaScript programs are also valid TypeScript programs. TypeScript may be used to develop JavaScript applications for both client-side and server-side execution. There are multiple options available for transcompilation.<p>You can download theTypeScriptlogo on full-version of the page.</p>
