LibreOffice is a free and open-source office productivity software suite, a project of The Document Foundation. It was forked in 2010 from OpenOffice.org, which was an open-sourced version of the earlier StarOffice. The LibreOffice suite consists of programs for word processing, creating and editing of spreadsheets, slideshows, diagrams and drawings, working with databases, and composing mathematical formulae. It is available in 115 languages. As its native file format to save documents for all of its applications, LibreOffice uses the Open Document Format for Office Applications, or OpenDocument, an international standard developed jointly by the International Organization for Standardization and the International Electrotechnical Commission.<p>You can download theLibreOfficelogo on full-version of the page.</p>
