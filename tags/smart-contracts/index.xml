Revain is an online platform for Ethereum blockchain-based tokens reviews, designed to allow developers to receive constructive feedback about their projects. The protocol also incentivizes authors to provide high-quality reviews.
Revain was the first platform to combine the features of traditional review sites and blockchain technology. Revain’s ultimate goal is to create a legitimate and genuine feedback structure for all global products and services that utilize emerging technologies, such as machine learning and blockchain.<p>You can download theRevainlogo on full-version of the page.</p>

Serum is a decentralized exchange (DEX) and an ecosystem that brings high speed and low transaction costs to decentralized finance (DeFi). It is permissionless and is built on the Solana blockchain.
Serum was created to eliminate the vulnerabilities in the current DeFi space that exist due to incomplete decentralization. It is claimed to be fully decentralized and runs on a non-custodial exchange with cross-chain trading support and no know your customer (KYC) requirements.<p>You can download theSerumlogo on full-version of the page.</p>

Utrust (UTK) was designed to provide a solution to the problems resulting in low usability of cryptocurrency as means of payment, particularly the underdeveloped transactional security of payment platforms and relatively high fees.
The main goal of the platform is to build a system that will enable fast and seamless crypto transactions at lower fees, therefore allowing merchants to reach a large audience of crypto holders.
The platform allows buyers to make secure purchases while also offering an option for refunds and protecting sellers from the high volatility of the crypto market.<p>You can download theUtrustlogo on full-version of the page.</p>

VeChain (VET) is a blockchain-powered supply chain platform. Begun in 2015 and launched in June 2016, VeChain aims to use distributed governance and Internet of Things (IoT) technology to create an ecosystem which solves some of the major problems with supply chain management.
The platform uses two in-house tokens, VET and VTHO, to manage and create value based on its VeChainThor public blockchain.
The idea is to boost the efficiency, traceability and transparency of supply chains while reducing costs and placing more control in the hands of individual users.<p>You can download theVeChainlogo on full-version of the page.</p>
