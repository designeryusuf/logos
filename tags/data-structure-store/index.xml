Redis is an in-memory data structure store, used as a distributed, in-memory key–value database, cache and message broker, with optional durability. Redis supports different kinds of abstract data structures, such as strings, lists, maps, sets, sorted sets, HyperLogLogs, bitmaps, streams, and spatial indices. The project is developed and maintained by a project core team and as of 2015 is sponsored by Redis Labs. It is open-source software released under a BSD 3-clause license.<p>You can download theRedislogo on full-version of the page.</p>
