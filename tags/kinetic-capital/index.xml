Orchid (OXT) is the native token of Orchid, a cryptocurrency-powered virtual private network (VPN).
Launched in December 2019, Orchid describes itself as the world’s first incentivized, peer-to-peer privacy network.
Its aim is to overcome internet freedom limitations by using cryptocurrency payments to allow anyone to purchase bandwidth from any participating provider. This is done using so-called probabilistic nanopayments, which occur using OXT, an ERC-20 standard token on Ethereum.<p>You can download theOrchidlogo on full-version of the page.</p>
