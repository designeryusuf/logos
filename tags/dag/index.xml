Obyte claims to be the first DAG-based cryptocurrency platform to support dApps. Due to the absence of miners and blocks, the team claims that there is no risk of front-running and other miner manipulation, and dApps are safer and easier to develop than blockchain-based dApps. DApps are developed in Oscript - a new language that avoids many unsafe programming patterns common in earlier dApp platforms.

Billed as the &amp;ldquo;trust layer of the internet,&amp;rdquo; Hedera Hashgraph is a public network that allows individuals and businesses to create powerful decentralized applications (DApps).
It is designed to be a fairer, more efficient system that eliminates some of the limitations that older blockchain-based platforms face — such as slow performance and instability.
It was funded through an initial coin offering (ICO) in August 2018 and first launched open access to its mainnet just over a year later in September 2019.<p>You can download theHedera Hashgraphlogo on full-version of the page.</p>
