Civic is a blockchain-based identity management solution that gives individuals and businesses the tools they need to control and protect personal identity information.
The platform is designed to change the way we think about identity verification by giving users more control over their personal data, while allowing them to access a wide range of services without needing to fork over excessive amounts of personal information.
Civic&amp;rsquo;s identity verification solution uses distributed ledger technology to authorize identity usage in real time, and is used to sparingly share information with Civic partners after authorization by the user.<p>You can download theCiviclogo on full-version of the page.</p>

&lt;! [CDATA[<header><h1> Solana (SOL) Logo</h1><figure><img src="https://logotyp.us/files/solana.svg"/></figure></header>
Solana is a highly functional open source project that banks on blockchain technology’s permissionless nature to provide decentralized finance (DeFi) solutions. While the idea and initial work on the project began in 2017, Solana was officially launched in March 2020 by the Solana Foundation with headquarters in Geneva, Switzerland.
The Solana protocol is designed to facilitate decentralized app (DApp) creation. It aims to improve scalability by introducing a proof-of-history (PoH) consensus combined with the underlying proof-of-stake (PoS) consensus of the blockchain.<p>You can download theSolanalogo on full-version of the page.</p>
