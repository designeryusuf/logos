Kubernetes is an open-source container-orchestration system for automating computer application deployment, scaling, and management. It was originally designed by Google and is now maintained by the Cloud Native Computing Foundation. It aims to provide a &amp;ldquo;platform for automating deployment, scaling, and operations of application containers across clusters of hosts&amp;rdquo;. It works with a range of container tools and runs containers in a cluster, often with images built using Docker. Kubernetes originally interfaced with the Docker runtime through a &amp;ldquo;Dockershim&amp;rdquo;; however, the shim has since been deprecated in favor of directly interfacing with the container through containerd, or replacing Docker with a runtime that is compliant with the Container Runtime Interface introduced by Kubernetes in 2016.<p>You can download theKuberneteslogo on full-version of the page.</p>
