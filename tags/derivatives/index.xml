DDX is the native token that is used for governance on the DerivaDEX exchange, fee reduction on the exchange, and for other programs. DDX is earned by users who stake in the insurance mining program. Users will earn a share of DDX proportional to their stake, distributed each block. About 5% of liquidity-mined DDX will be distributed as part of the insurance mining program. DDX is not a fundraising device nor an investment opportunity.<p>You can download theDerivaDAOlogo on full-version of the page.</p>

In essence, UMA allows counterparties to digitize and automate any real-world financial derivatives, such as futures, contracts for differences (CFDs) or total return swaps.<p>You can download theUMAlogo on full-version of the page.</p>
