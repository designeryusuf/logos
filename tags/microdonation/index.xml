Flattr is a Swedish-based microdonation subscription service, where subscribers opt-in to pay a monthly patronage to help fund their favourite websites and creators. Flattr subscribers install an open-source browser extension that records which websites they frequent and shares this data with Flattr. Flattr processes this user data and pays out shares of the user&amp;rsquo;s subscription to each registered Flattr creator based on which websites the user consumed. Flattr filters websites by domains with a default whitelist of participating domains, but individual users can override and contribute to any website they want or withhold contributions from any website.<p>You can download theFlattrlogo on full-version of the page.</p>
