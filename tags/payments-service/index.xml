The Faster Payments Service is a United Kingdom banking initiative to reduce payment times between different banks' customer accounts to typically a few seconds, from the three working days that transfers usually take using the long-established BACS system. CHAPS, which was introduced in 1984, provides a limited faster-than-BACS service for &amp;ldquo;high value&amp;rdquo; transactions, while FPS is focused on the much larger number of smaller payments, subject to limits set by the individual banks, with some allowing Faster Payments of up to £250,000.<p>You can download theFaster Paymentslogo on full-version of the page.</p>
