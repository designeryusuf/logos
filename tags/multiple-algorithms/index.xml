Myriad is a cryptocurrency that supports 5 algorithms, catering for ASIC, GPU and CPU mining. Currently, those algorithms consist of SHA256d, Scrypt, Myr-Groestl, Argon2d, and Yescrypt. Myriad&amp;rsquo;s multi-algorithm approach offers 51% attack resistance as a range of different hardware would be needed to find 51% of the blocks. Merge mining is available on the SHA256d and Scrypt algorithms, enabling Myriad to take advantage of the hashrates used by the coins leveraging these algorithms (BTC, LTC)<p>You can download theMyriadlogo on full-version of the page.</p>
