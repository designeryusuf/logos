Adobe Dimension is a discontinued 3D rendering and design software developed and published by Adobe Systems for macOS and Windows operating systems. It was founded as Project Felix on March 28, 2017, and became Dimension on October 18, 2017. Unlike other modeling programs such as SketchUp, models are not created in Dimension. Instead, it is a photo-based mockup editor where models, photos and textures need to be created in third-party software before being imported into Dimension.<p>You can download theAdobe Dimensionlogo on full-version of the page.</p>
