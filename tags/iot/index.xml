Waltonchain (WTC) is building an ecosystem that melds blockchain, RFID technology, and IoT (Internet of Things). The Walton team develops and produces Transaction ID-reading RFID chips, which can generate their own random ID hashes that are uploaded simultaneously to the blockchain via their RFID reader. This translates to enhanced operational efficiency, especially for supply chain use cases such high-end clothing identification, food &amp;amp; drug traceability, and logistics tracking.

Helium (HNT) is a decentralized blockchain-powered network for Internet of Things (IoT) devices.
Launched in July 2019, the Helium mainnet allows low-powered wireless devices to communicate with each other and send data across its network of nodes.
Nodes come in the form of so-called Hotspots, which are a combination of a wireless gateway and a blockchain mining device. Users who operate nodes thus mine and earn rewards in Helium’s native cryptocurrency token, HNT.<p>You can download theHeliumlogo on full-version of the page.</p>
