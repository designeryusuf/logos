KCS is the native token of KuCoin, which was launched back in 2017 as a profit-sharing token that allows traders to draw value from the exchange. It was issued as an ERC-20 token running on the Ethereum network and was supported by most Ethereum wallets. The total supply of KCS was set at 200 million, and there is a planned buyback and burn until just 100 million KCS remain. Sooner or later, as the KuCoin decentralized trading solution goes live, KCS will be the native asset of KuCoin&amp;rsquo;s decentralized financial services as well as the governance token of the KuCoin community in the future.<p>You can download theKuCoinlogo on full-version of the page.</p>
