Lisk is a blockchain application platform aiming to create an accessible future where everyone can benefit from decentralized technology.
Lisk enables developers to build applications as well as deploy a side-chain linked to the Lisk network that includes a custom token. Lisk empowers developers with a software development kit for blockchain applications and is working on an interoperability solution that will in turn let everyone seamlessly use it on the platform.<p>You can download theLisklogo on full-version of the page.</p>

&lt;! [CDATA[<header><h1> Solana (SOL) Logo</h1><figure><img src="https://logotyp.us/files413/solana.svg"/></figure></header>
Solana is a highly functional open source project that banks on blockchain technology’s permissionless nature to provide decentralized finance (DeFi) solutions. While the idea and initial work on the project began in 2017, Solana was officially launched in March 2020 by the Solana Foundation with headquarters in Geneva, Switzerland.
The Solana protocol is designed to facilitate decentralized app (DApp) creation. It aims to improve scalability by introducing a proof-of-history (PoH) consensus combined with the underlying proof-of-stake (PoS) consensus of the blockchain.<p>You can download theSolanalogo on full-version of the page.</p>
