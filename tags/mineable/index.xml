Bitcoin Diamond (BCD) is a hard fork of Bitcoin. The fork occurring at at block height 495866, implemented changes including a new proof of work algorithm to deter attacks on the network and segregation of transaction signatures from transactions on the chain for additional capacity allowing a greater number of transactions per second on the network as a whole.

Bitcoin Gold was founded in 2017 to become a user-friendly alternative to Bitcoin. The BTG network aims to combine the security and sturdiness of the Bitcoin blockchain and its characteristics with the opportunity for experimentation and development.
BTG enhances and extends the crypto space with a blockchain closely compatible with Bitcoin but without using resources like Bitcoin hash power or vying for the &amp;ldquo;real Bitcoin&amp;rdquo; title. The company aims to present a coin with the implementation capabilities of Bitcoin, however, expanding on the opportunities for DeFi and DApp developers to use the coin.<p>You can download theBitcoin Goldlogo on full-version of the page.</p>

Bitcoin SV is the result of a lot of drama on the BTC blockchain.
It all began when Bitcoin suffered a hard fork in 2017 — splitting the network and resulting in the creation of a new altcoin called Bitcoin Cash.
A year later, in 2018, Bitcoin Cash suffered a hard fork of its own, and Bitcoin SV was born.
Bitcoin SV (SV stands for Satoshi Vision) bills itself as the original Bitcoin — a cryptocurrency that stays true to the goals of pseudonymous founder Satoshi Nakamoto.<p>You can download theBitcoin SVlogo on full-version of the page.</p>

DigiByte (DGB) is an open source blockchain and asset creation platform. Development began in October 2013 and the genesis block of its DGB token was mined in January 2014 as a fork of Bitcoin (BTC).
A longstanding public blockchain and cryptocurrency, DigiByte uses five different algorithms to improve security, and originally aimed to improve on the Bitcoin blockchain’s security, capacity and transaction speed.
DigiByte consists of three layers: a smart contract “App Store,” a public ledger and the core protocol featuring nodes communicating to relay transactions.<p>You can download theDigiBytelogo on full-version of the page.</p>

Helium (HNT) is a decentralized blockchain-powered network for Internet of Things (IoT) devices.
Launched in July 2019, the Helium mainnet allows low-powered wireless devices to communicate with each other and send data across its network of nodes.
Nodes come in the form of so-called Hotspots, which are a combination of a wireless gateway and a blockchain mining device. Users who operate nodes thus mine and earn rewards in Helium’s native cryptocurrency token, HNT.<p>You can download theHeliumlogo on full-version of the page.</p>
