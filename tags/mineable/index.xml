BEAM is a confidential decentralized finance (DeFi) platform that runs on a combination of two blockchain protocols (LelantusMW and Mimblewimble).
In the early years of the industry, transactions with public-blockchain cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin (BTC) were thought to be untraceable. With developments in blockchain analysis, it became clear that transactions can actually be traced back to the senders, posing a great threat to users' privacy.
To solve this issue, BEAM came up with innovative ways of increasing the anonymity of transactions, address balances and user identities.<p>You can download theBeamlogo on full-version of the page.</p>

Bitcoin SV is the result of a lot of drama on the BTC blockchain.
It all began when Bitcoin suffered a hard fork in 2017 — splitting the network and resulting in the creation of a new altcoin called Bitcoin Cash.
A year later, in 2018, Bitcoin Cash suffered a hard fork of its own, and Bitcoin SV was born.
Bitcoin SV (SV stands for Satoshi Vision) bills itself as the original Bitcoin — a cryptocurrency that stays true to the goals of pseudonymous founder Satoshi Nakamoto.<p>You can download theBitcoin SVlogo on full-version of the page.</p>

DigiByte (DGB) is an open source blockchain and asset creation platform. Development began in October 2013 and the genesis block of its DGB token was mined in January 2014 as a fork of Bitcoin (BTC).
A longstanding public blockchain and cryptocurrency, DigiByte uses five different algorithms to improve security, and originally aimed to improve on the Bitcoin blockchain’s security, capacity and transaction speed.
DigiByte consists of three layers: a smart contract “App Store,” a public ledger and the core protocol featuring nodes communicating to relay transactions.<p>You can download theDigiBytelogo on full-version of the page.</p>

Helium (HNT) is a decentralized blockchain-powered network for Internet of Things (IoT) devices.
Launched in July 2019, the Helium mainnet allows low-powered wireless devices to communicate with each other and send data across its network of nodes.
Nodes come in the form of so-called Hotspots, which are a combination of a wireless gateway and a blockchain mining device. Users who operate nodes thus mine and earn rewards in Helium’s native cryptocurrency token, HNT.<p>You can download theHeliumlogo on full-version of the page.</p>
