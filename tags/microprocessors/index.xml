MIPS Technologies, Inc., formerly MIPS Computer Systems, Inc., was an American fabless semiconductor design company that is most widely known for developing the MIPS architecture and a series of RISC CPU chips based on it. MIPS provides processor architectures and cores for digital home, networking, embedded, Internet of things and mobile applications. MIPS was founded in 1984 to commercialize the work being carried out at Stanford University on the MIPS architecture, a pioneering RISC design.<p>You can download theMIPSlogo on full-version of the page.</p>

Athlon is the brand name applied to a series of x86-compatible microprocessors designed and manufactured by Advanced Micro Devices. The original Athlon was the first seventh-generation x86 processor and was the first desktop processor to reach speeds of one gigahertz. It made its debut as AMD&amp;rsquo;s high-end processor brand on June 23, 1999. Over the years AMD has used the Athlon name with the 64-bit Athlon 64 architecture, the Athlon II, and Accelerated Processing Unit chips targeting the Socket AM1 desktop SoC architecture, and Socket AM4 Zen microarchitecture.<p>You can download theAthlonlogo on full-version of the page.</p>
