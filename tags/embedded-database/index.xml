RocksDB is a high performance embedded database for key-value data. It is a fork of Google&amp;rsquo;s LevelDB optimized to exploit many CPU cores, and make efficient use of fast storage, such as solid-state drives, for input/output bound workloads. It is based on a log-structured merge-tree data structure. It is written in C++ and provides official language bindings for C++, C, and Java; alongside many third-party language bindings. RocksDB is open-source software, and was originally released under a BSD 3-clause license.<p>You can download theRocksDBlogo on full-version of the page.</p>
