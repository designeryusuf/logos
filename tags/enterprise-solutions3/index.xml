Civic is a blockchain-based identity management solution that gives individuals and businesses the tools they need to control and protect personal identity information.
The platform is designed to change the way we think about identity verification by giving users more control over their personal data, while allowing them to access a wide range of services without needing to fork over excessive amounts of personal information.
Civic&amp;rsquo;s identity verification solution uses distributed ledger technology to authorize identity usage in real time, and is used to sparingly share information with Civic partners after authorization by the user.<p>You can download theCiviclogo on full-version of the page.</p>
