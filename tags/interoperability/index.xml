Whitecoin is a community-based decentralization project with more than five years of history. The project was launched in early 2014. The main members of the original development team are from the Netherlands, Germany, Finland, Australia and other countries.
The newly upgraded Whitecoin will adopt RPOS mechanism to realize the functions such as cross-chain asset management, cross-chain transfer, exchange, and cross-chain value transfer. The upgraded Whitecoin public chain provides three main functions: cross-chain assets management, smart contracts, decentralized exchanges, and the core feature: community governance mechanisms.<p>You can download theWhiteCoinlogo on full-version of the page.</p>

Quant launched in June 2018 with the goal of connecting blockchains and networks on a global scale, without reducing the efficiency and interoperability of the network. It is the first project to solve the interoperability problem through the creation of the first blockchain operating system.
The project is built as an operating system distributed ledger technology— and Overledger Network — for connecting different blockchain networks. The project is billed as the first OS to be built for blockchains.<p>You can download theQuantlogo on full-version of the page.</p>
