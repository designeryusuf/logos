The word cryptex is a neologism coined by the author Dan Brown for his 2003 novel The Da Vinci Code, denoting a portable vault used to hide secret messages. It is a word formed from Greek κρυπτός kryptós, &amp;ldquo;hidden, secret&amp;rdquo; and Latin codex; &amp;ldquo;an apt title for this device&amp;rdquo; since it uses &amp;ldquo;the science of cryptology to protect information written on the contained scroll or codex&amp;rdquo;. The first physical cryptex was created by Justin Kirk Nevins in 2004.<p>You can download theKryptexlogo on full-version of the page.</p>
