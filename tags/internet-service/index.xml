Flightradar24 is a Swedish internet-based service that shows real-time commercial aircraft flight tracking information on a map. It includes flight tracking information, origins and destinations, flight numbers, aircraft types, positions, altitudes, headings and speeds. It can also show time-lapse replays of previous tracks and historical flight data by airline, aircraft, aircraft type, area or airport. It aggregates data from multiple sources but, outside of the United States, mostly from crowdsourced information gathering by volunteers with ADS-B receivers, and from satellite-based ADS-B receivers.<p>You can download theFlightradar24logo on full-version of the page.</p>
