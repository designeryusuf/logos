Israel Railways Ltd., dba Israel Railways, is the state-owned principal railway company responsible for all inter-city, commuter, and freight rail transport in Israel. Israel Railways network consists of 1,138 kilometers of track. All its lines are standard gauge. The network is centered in Israel&amp;rsquo;s densely populated coastal plain, from which lines radiate out in many directions. In 2018, Israel Railways carried 68 million passengers.
