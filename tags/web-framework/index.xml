Django is a Python-based free and open-source web framework that follows the model–template–views architectural pattern. It is maintained by the Django Software Foundation, an American independent organization established as a 501 non-profit. Django&amp;rsquo;s primary goal is to ease the creation of complex, database-driven websites. The framework emphasizes reusability and &amp;ldquo;pluggability&amp;rdquo; of components, less code, low coupling, rapid development, and the principle of don&amp;rsquo;t repeat yourself. Python is used throughout, even for settings, files, and data models.<p>You can download theDjangologo on full-version of the page.</p>

&lt;! [CDATA[<header><h1>Flask Logo</h1><figure><img src="https://logotyp.us/files/flask.svg"/></figure></header>
Flask is a micro web framework written in Python. It is classified as a microframework because it does not require particular tools or libraries. It has no database abstraction layer, form validation, or any other components where pre-existing third-party libraries provide common functions. However, Flask supports extensions that can add application features as if they were implemented in Flask itself. Extensions exist for object-relational mappers, form validation, upload handling, various open authentication technologies and several common framework related tools.<p>You can download theFlasklogo on full-version of the page.</p>
