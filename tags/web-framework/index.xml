AngularJS is a JavaScript-based open-source front-end web framework for developing single-page applications. It is maintained mainly by Google and a community of individuals and corporations. It aims to simplify both the development and the testing of such applications by providing a framework for client-side model–view–controller and model–view–viewmodel architectures, along with components commonly used in web applications and progressive web applications. AngularJS is used as the frontend of the MEAN stack, consisting of MongoDB database, Express.<p>You can download theAngularJSlogo on full-version of the page.</p>

Django is a Python-based free and open-source web framework that follows the model–template–views architectural pattern. It is maintained by the Django Software Foundation, an American independent organization established as a 501 non-profit. Django&amp;rsquo;s primary goal is to ease the creation of complex, database-driven websites. The framework emphasizes reusability and &amp;ldquo;pluggability&amp;rdquo; of components, less code, low coupling, rapid development, and the principle of don&amp;rsquo;t repeat yourself. Python is used throughout, even for settings, files, and data models.<p>You can download theDjangologo on full-version of the page.</p>

&lt;! [CDATA[<header><h1>Flask Logo</h1><figure><img src="https://logotyp.us/files/flask.svg"/></figure></header>
Flask is a micro web framework written in Python. It is classified as a microframework because it does not require particular tools or libraries. It has no database abstraction layer, form validation, or any other components where pre-existing third-party libraries provide common functions. However, Flask supports extensions that can add application features as if they were implemented in Flask itself. Extensions exist for object-relational mappers, form validation, upload handling, various open authentication technologies and several common framework related tools.<p>You can download theFlasklogo on full-version of the page.</p>
