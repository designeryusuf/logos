The Nervos Network describes itself as an open-source public blockchain ecosystem and collection of protocols. The Nervos CKB (Common Knowledge Base) is the layer 1, proof of work public blockchain protocol of the Nervos Network. It reportedly allows any crypto-asset to be stored with the security, immutability and permissionless nature of Bitcoin while enabling smart contracts and layer 2 scaling. It aims to capture the total network value through its &amp;ldquo;store of value&amp;rdquo; crypto-economic design and native token, the CKByte.<p>You can download theNervos Networklogo on full-version of the page.</p>

NuCypher is a decentralized encryption, access control and key management system (KMS), encryption service for public blockchains. NuCypher offers end-to-end encrypted data sharing on public blockchains and decentralized storage solutions.
NuCypher allows users to share private data between a number of participants in public consensus networks, using proxy re-encryption (PRE) technology. This decryption technology makes NuCypher much more secure and protected than traditional blockchain projects based on public-key encryption, according to NuCypher.<p>You can download theNuCypherlogo on full-version of the page.</p>

Orchid (OXT) is the native token of Orchid, a cryptocurrency-powered virtual private network (VPN).
Launched in December 2019, Orchid describes itself as the world’s first incentivized, peer-to-peer privacy network.
Its aim is to overcome internet freedom limitations by using cryptocurrency payments to allow anyone to purchase bandwidth from any participating provider. This is done using so-called probabilistic nanopayments, which occur using OXT, an ERC-20 standard token on Ethereum.<p>You can download theOrchidlogo on full-version of the page.</p>
