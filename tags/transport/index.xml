Aeron’s solution relies on blockchain technology to track aircraft maintenance and pilot logs. Aeron is constructing a database and an online system that is decentralized, hosting global data on aircraft, flight schools, and pilots. This electronic logging system would force pilots to have logs that reflect accurate flight hours, making aviation safer for everyone involved. Its aim is to create “airline in a pocket” — a smart blockchain-based solution. The pilot’s application is used by a pilot for personal flight logging.<p>You can download theAeronlogo on full-version of the page.</p>
