Cygwin is a POSIX-compatible programming and runtime environment that runs natively on Microsoft Windows. Under Cygwin, source code designed for Unix-like operating systems may be compiled with minimal modification and executed. The Cygwin installation directory has a directory layout that is similar to the root file system of Unix-like systems, with familiar directories, such as /bin, /home, /etc, /usr, /var. Cygwin installs with hundreds of command-line tools and other programs commonly found on a Unix-like system.<p>You can download theCygwinlogo on full-version of the page.</p>
