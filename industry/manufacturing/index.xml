Swatch (stylized as swatch) is a Swiss watchmaker founded in 1983 by Ernst Thomke, Elmar Mock, and Jacques Müller, and a flagship subsidiary of The Swatch Group. The Swatch product line was developed as a response to the &amp;ldquo;quartz crisis&amp;rdquo; of the 1970s and 1980s, in which Asian-made digital watches were competing against traditional European-made mechanical watches.
The name Swatch is a contraction of &amp;ldquo;second watch&amp;rdquo;, as the watches were intended as casual, disposable accessories.
