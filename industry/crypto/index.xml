It redesigns app advertising, in-app purchases (IAP), and app approval flows through a circular model. As a higher share of the advertising and IAP revenue is kept within the app ecosystem, more value is retained in the app economy.

While they are great for smart contracts, they are slow, not flexible at all, and inconvenient for full applications, according to Elastos.</description></item><item turbo="true"><turbo:content>

Released in December 2018, TomoChain (TOMO) is a project that attempts to improve the scalability of the Ethereum (ETH) blockchain. This is primarily done via increasing its transactions per second (TPS) capacity.
