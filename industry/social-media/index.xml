      <description>Tinder is a location-based social search mobile app and Web application most often used as a dating service, that allows users to use a swiping motion to like (swipe right) or dislike (swipe left) other users, and allows users to chat if both parties like each other (a “match”). Information available to users is based on pictures, a short biography, and, optionally, a linked Instagram, Facebook or Spotify account. Tinder originally required access to a Facebook account of the user of Tinder but, as of 2019‑08‑17, Tinder allows users to register using a telephone number and without access to a Facebook account.</description>

      <description>New Facebook Logo  The company unveiled its new logo Tuesday, April 30, 2019. The new logo retains the distinctive “f” letter, but replaces the rounded square container with a circle. In addition, the new look moves the “f” to the center of the icon, rather than the right side like in the old version. The “Facebook” logotype that has the full name of the company is now relegated to use only for the company — but not its services.</description>
