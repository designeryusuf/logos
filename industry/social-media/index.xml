      <description>New Facebook Logo  The company unveiled its new logo Tuesday, April 30, 2019. The new logo retains the distinctive “f” letter, but replaces the rounded square container with a circle. In addition, the new look moves the “f” to the center of the icon, rather than the right side like in the old version. The “Facebook” logotype that has the full name of the company is now relegated to use only for the company — but not its services.</description>
