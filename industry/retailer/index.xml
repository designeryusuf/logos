      <description>Staples Inc. is a Massachusetts-based retail company. It is primarily involved in the sale of office supplies and related products, via retail channels and business-to-business (B2B)-oriented delivery operations.

Still, with Staples placing more emphasis on its B2B operation, the redesign will have its biggest impact there.</description>
