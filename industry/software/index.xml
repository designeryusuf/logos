It allows importing/saving, viewing, organizing, tagging, editing, and sharing large numbers of digital images. Unlike Photoshop, Lightroom&amp;rsquo;s edits are always non-destructive by keeping the original image and the edits applied to it saved separately. Despite sharing its name with Adobe Photoshop, it cannot perform many Photoshop functions such as doctoring (adding, removing or altering the appearance of individual image items), rendering text or 3D objects on images, or modifying individual video frames.

Since then, this software has become the industry standard not only in raster graphics editing, but in digital art as a whole. The software&amp;rsquo;s name has thus become a generic trademark, leading to its usage as a verb (e.g. &amp;ldquo;to photoshop an image&amp;rdquo;, &amp;ldquo;photoshopping&amp;rdquo;, and &amp;ldquo;photoshop contest&amp;rdquo;) although Adobe discourages such use.

Docker is a set of platform-as-a-service (PaaS) products that use OS-level virtualization to deliver software in packages called containers. Containers are isolated from one another and bundle their own software, libraries and configuration files; they can communicate with each other through well-defined channels. All containers are run by a single operating-system kernel and are thus more lightweight than virtual machines.
