Adobe Lightroom is a family of image organization and image manipulation software developed by Adobe Systems for Windows, macOS, iOS, Android, and tvOS (Apple TV). It allows importing/saving, viewing, organizing, tagging, editing, and sharing large numbers of digital images. Unlike Photoshop, Lightroom&amp;rsquo;s edits are always non-destructive by keeping the original image and the edits applied to it saved separately. Despite sharing its name with Adobe Photoshop, it cannot perform many Photoshop functions such as doctoring (adding, removing or altering the appearance of individual image items), rendering text or 3D objects on images, or modifying individual video frames.<p>You can download theLightroomlogo on full-version of the page.</p>

Adobe Photoshop is a raster graphics editor developed and published by Adobe Inc. for Windows and macOS. It was originally created in 1988 by Thomas and John Knoll.

The software&amp;rsquo;s name has thus become a generic trademark, leading to its usage as a verb (e.g. &amp;ldquo;to photoshop an image&amp;rdquo;, &amp;ldquo;photoshopping&amp;rdquo;, and &amp;ldquo;photoshop contest&amp;rdquo;) although Adobe discourages such use.<p>You can download thePhotoshoplogo on full-version of the page.</p>
