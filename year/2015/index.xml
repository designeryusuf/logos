      <description>About Google Google is an American multinational technology company that specializes in Internet-related services and products. These include online advertising technologies, search, cloud computing, software, and hardware. Google was founded in 1998 by Larry Page and Sergey Brin while they were Ph.D. students at Stanford University in California.
The current Google logo was released on Sept 1 2015. A sans serif logotype retains googleâ€™s distinct multi-color sequence, and a compact version of the Google icon works in small contexts.</description>
