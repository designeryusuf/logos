Penguin Books Logo History Designed by Edward Young In 1935, Edward Young designed Penguin’s famous “dignified but flippant” logo and the colour scheme for its book covers.
It started with the simple logo and name, suggested, allegedly, by a typist who was earwigging the board meeting. Allen had already hit upon the idea of an animal logo, inspired by the template offered by the contemporary publishing house The Albatross Library.
