In 1998 financial giants Citicorp and Travelers Group merged to create Citigroup, the largest financial company in the world.

      <description>History of the Amazon Logo (from logomyway.com and 1000logos.net) The Amazon logo has had three different iterations over the years, but neither of the first two stuck around for very long. The company’s first logo was simply the word Amazon.com spelled out in black font with a larger, yellow font used for the “o”. This design was later replaced with a logo that featured the company name with a near-straight yellow line beneath it.</description>
